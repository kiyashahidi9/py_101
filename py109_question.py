"""
Command-Line Program to randomly generate practice questions from
Launch School's PY101 curriculum questions.

How to use:

1. Run the program in the command line: python test_generator.py
This should output five practice questions like the following:
	Practice question 1: answer Exercises / Easy1 / 3
	Practice question 2: answer Lesson3 / Easy2 / 8
	Practice question 3: answer Exercises / Easy 3 / 4
	Practice question 4: answer Lesson3 / Medium / 4
	Practice question 5: answer Lesson3 / Hard / 4

2. Look up the respective questions in LaunchSchool's curriculum, 
    either in PY101 Lesson3 or in Exercises. 

3. Practice answering those questions whenever you want.
